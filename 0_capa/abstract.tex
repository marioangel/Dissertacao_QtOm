The software development process for embedded systems is getting faster and faster, which generally incurs an increase in the associated complexity. As a consequence, consumer electronics companies usually invest a lot of resources in fast and automatic verification mechanisms, in order to create robust systems and reduce product recall rates. In addition, further development-time reduction and system robustness can be achieved through cross-platform frameworks, such as Qt, which favor the reliable port of software stacks to different devices. Based on that, the present work proposes a simplified version of the Qt framework, which is integrated into a checker based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), name as the efficient SMT-based bounded model checker (ESBMC++), for verifying actual Qt-based applications, and presents a success rate of 89\%, for the developed benchmark suite. We also evaluate our simplified version of the Qt framework using other state-of-the-art verifiers for C++ programs. It is worth mentioning that the proposed methodology is the first one to formally verify Qt-based applications, which has the potential to devise new directions for software verification of portable code.
